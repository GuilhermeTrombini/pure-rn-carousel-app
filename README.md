# Pure React Native Carousel

This repo has the objective of providing a pure carousel for those that want to run away from the usual carousels plugins.

Use the basic install of a React Native project to check the pure component.

Acctually it's receiving an array with objects with title and another array of images, then on each render he picks a different image to be redered.

Have fun and check the source code!
